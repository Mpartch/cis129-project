print("Once upon a time there was a dog named Sparky.") 
print("Sparky wasn't a regular dog however. His ears were so big that he could fly.")
print("He would flap his ears whenever his owner took him outside.")
print('Sparky did not want to walk like "regular dogs" do.')
print("Until one night he saw this beautiful golden retriever walking down the street.")
print("Ever since he saw her, Sparky now perfers to walk on the ground at night.")
